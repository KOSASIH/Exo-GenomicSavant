### Extraterrestrial DNA Sequence Classification using Deep Learning Models

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will demonstrate the use of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to classify extraterrestrial DNA sequences based on their function or characteristics.

#### Dataset
Before we begin, we need a dataset of labeled extraterrestrial DNA sequences. The dataset should be organized in a directory structure where each class has its own subdirectory. For example:
```
dataset/
    ├── class1/
    │   ├── sequence1.fasta
    │   ├── sequence2.fasta
    │   └── ...
    ├── class2/
    │   ├── sequence1.fasta
    │   ├── sequence2.fasta
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```
Each DNA sequence should be stored in a FASTA file format.

#### Preprocessing the Dataset
We will start by preprocessing the dataset, which involves loading the DNA sequences, converting them into numerical representations, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
import os
import numpy as np
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

def preprocess_dataset(dataset_path, max_sequence_length):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    classes = os.listdir(dataset_path)
    
    for class_name in classes:
        class_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, class_name)
        for file_name in os.listdir(class_path):
            file_path = os.path.join(class_path, file_name)
            sequence = str(SeqIO.read(file_path, "fasta").seq)
            sequences.append(sequence)
            labels.append(class_name)
    
    tokenizer = Tokenizer()
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sequences)
    sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sequences)
    sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_sequence_length)
    
    label_mapping = {class_name: i for i, class_name in enumerate(set(labels))}
    labels = [label_mapping[label] for label in labels]
    
    sequences = np.array(sequences)
    labels = np.array(labels)
    
    train_sequences, test_sequences, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(
        sequences, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    return train_sequences, test_sequences, train_labels, test_labels, label_mapping
```

#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
Next, we will define a CNN model for classifying the DNA sequences. The model will consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

def create_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128, input_length=input_shape[1]))
    model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
    model.add(Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
    
    return model
```

#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model
Alternatively, we can use an RNN model for classifying the DNA sequences. The model will consist of LSTM or GRU layers and a fully connected layer.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

def create_rnn_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128, input_length=input_shape[1]))
    model.add(LSTM(64))
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
    
    return model
```

#### Training and Evaluation
Now, let's train and evaluate our models using the preprocessed dataset.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

def train_and_evaluate_model(model, train_sequences, train_labels, test_sequences, test_labels):
    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=3, monitor='val_loss', restore_best_weights=True)
    
    model.fit(train_sequences, train_labels, validation_data=(test_sequences, test_labels),
              epochs=10, batch_size=32, callbacks=[early_stopping])
    
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_sequences, test_labels)
    
    return accuracy
```

#### Putting It All Together
Finally, let's put everything together in a Jupyter Notebook and run the classification task.

```python
# Preprocessing the dataset
dataset_path = 'path/to/dataset'
max_sequence_length = 1000
train_sequences, test_sequences, train_labels, test_labels, label_mapping = preprocess_dataset(dataset_path, max_sequence_length)

# Creating and training the CNN model
cnn_model = create_cnn_model(train_sequences.shape, len(label_mapping))
cnn_accuracy = train_and_evaluate_model(cnn_model, train_sequences, train_labels, test_sequences, test_labels)

# Creating and training the RNN model
rnn_model = create_rnn_model(train_sequences.shape, len(label_mapping))
rnn_accuracy = train_and_evaluate_model(rnn_model, train_sequences, train_labels, test_sequences, test_labels)

print(f"CNN Accuracy: {cnn_accuracy}")
print(f"RNN Accuracy: {rnn_accuracy}")
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dataset'` with the actual path to your dataset directory.

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of CNN and RNN models for classifying extraterrestrial DNA sequences. You can experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics to improve the classification accuracy.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

def load_genome(genome_id):
    # Load the extraterrestrial genome sequence from a specified database
    # and return the DNA sequence
    # Replace 'database' with the actual database name or API call
    genome_sequence = 'database.get_sequence(genome_id)'
    return genome_sequence

def edit_genome(genome_sequence, target_gene_sequence, modification):
    # Perform targeted gene editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 system
    # Replace the following code with the actual CRISPR-Cas9 implementation
    edited_sequence = genome_sequence.replace(target_gene_sequence, modification)
    return edited_sequence

# Example usage
genome_id = 'ET123'
target_gene_sequence = 'ATGCTGACGT'
modification = 'ATGCTGCCGT'
genome_sequence = load_genome(genome_id)
edited_sequence = edit_genome(genome_sequence, target_gene_sequence, modification)

# Output the modified genome sequence in a markdown code block
print(f"```\n{edited_sequence}\n```")
```

Explanation:
1. The `load_genome` function loads the extraterrestrial genome sequence from a specified database. You need to replace `'database.get_sequence(genome_id)'` with the actual code to retrieve the sequence from the database.
2. The `edit_genome` function performs targeted gene editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In this example, it replaces the target gene sequence with the desired modification. You need to replace this code with the actual CRISPR-Cas9 implementation.
3. The example usage section demonstrates how to use the `load_genome` and `edit_genome` functions. It loads the genome sequence, performs gene editing, and stores the modified sequence in the `edited_sequence` variable.
4. Finally, it outputs the modified genome sequence in a markdown code block using the `print` statement.
